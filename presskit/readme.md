# Presskit

Possible Bodies is a collaboration between the [Master Media Design](https://www.hesge.ch/head/en/programs-research/master-arts-media-design) ([HEAD – Genève](https://www.hesge.ch/head/en/)) and [Swiss Paraplegic Group](https://www.paraplegie.ch/en/).

This project focuses on creating playful, immersive virtual reality experiences to facilitate the rehabilitation of people with motor difficulties. The result will be six functional and semi-functional virtual reality prototypes.

Our mission in this project is to develop unique prototypes that use immersive gameplay to explore new potentials for rehabilitation.
